### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs and previous projects helped in setting us up for success in tackling the kudos project. Such as the flixster project and student store helped us in completing the kudos project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If we had more time, we would have added the stretch features such as comments and user accounts. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went well, we were able to efficiently take turns to talk about the aspects of our website.
